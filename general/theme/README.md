## Themes for Quirinux Pro and Quirinux General

Quirinux will have 2 editions: General and Pro. Quirinux General does not contain applications for animation. 
Therefore there will be two themes for Calamares.
At the moment I only have "finished" the theme for the Quirinux General edition.

## Another subfolders

Quirinux will have 2 editions: General and Pro. Therefore there will be two themes for Calamares.

In this repository I also store the necessary files for other aspects of the theme when creating the iso with Piero Proietti's EGGS program.

### Known issues:

1) Languages are not working.

3) Grub menu customization either.
